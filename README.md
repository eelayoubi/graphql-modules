**GraphQL Modules** is a toolset of libraries and guidelines dedicated to **create reusable, maintainable, testable and extendable modules** out of your GraphQL server.

- **[Website](https://graphql-modules.com/docs/introduction/getting-started)**
- **[Introducing GraphQL Modules - Feature based GraphQL Modules at scale](https://medium.com/the-guild/graphql-modules-feature-based-graphql-modules-at-scale-2d7b2b0da6da)**

- **[Authentication with AccountsJS & GraphQL Modules](https://medium.com/the-guild/authentication-with-accountsjs-graphql-modules-e0fb9799a9da)**


## Highlights

- **Reusable modules** - Modules are defined by their GraphQL schema (Schema first design). They're completely independent and can be shared between apps.
- **Scalable structure** - Manage multiple teams and features, multiple micro-services and servers.
- **Gradual growth** - A clear, gradual path from a very simple and fast, single-file modules, to scalable multi-file, multi-teams, multi-repo, multi-server modules.
- **Testable** - A rich toolset around testing, mocking and separation.

## Documentation

Documentation is available at [graphql-modules.com](https://graphql-modules.com/docs/introduction/getting-started) or inside the [docs](./docs/) directory.

## Installation

To install graphql-modules, use the following:

```sh
$ npm install @graphql-modules/core
    
# Or, with Yarn
    
$ yarn add @graphql-modules/core
```

Or, in alternative, just use the graphql-modules-seed to get started:

    $ git clone https://github.com/darkbasic/graphql-modules-seed.git

#### Pre-release

We are also publishing a pre-release version to NPM on each change.

Just take a look at the build status on CircleCI and find "Publish Canary" job to get the published version.

## Usage

More advanced usage at [graphql-modules.com](https://graphql-modules.com/docs/introduction/getting-started)

```js
import { GraphQLModule } from '@graphql-modules/core';

const module = new GraphQLModule({
  typeDefs: gql`
    type Post {
      id: ID
      title: String
      author: User
    }
    
    type Query {
      posts: [Post]
    }
  `,
  resolvers: blogResolvers,
  imports: [UserModule],
});
```

Inside the `examples` directory you can find the following examples:

- [Simple GraphQL-Modules example](./examples/basic)
- [Using dependenecy injection in GraphQL Modules](./examples/basic-with-dependency-injection)
- You can also take a look at the [graphql-modules-seed](https://github.com/darkbasic/graphql-modules-seed) repository.

## GraphQL Code Generator integration

GraphQL Modules easily integrates with [GraphQL Code Generator](https://github.com/dotansimha/graphql-code-generator). To see how look at the [graphql-modules-seed](https://github.com/darkbasic/graphql-modules-seed).

## Troubleshoot

If you have issues with the generator, feel free open issues in this repository.

## Contributing

Feel free to open issues (for bugs/questions) and create pull requests (add generators / fix bugs).
